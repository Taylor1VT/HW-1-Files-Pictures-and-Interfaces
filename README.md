### Authors
Taylor Ampatiellos
Isaac Rothschild

### Help
C Interfaces and Implementations by David Hanson
The C Programming Language by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
Carter helped us understand Checked Runtime Errors

### Implemented
To the best of our knowledge, we have implemented everything in the spec. 
Readaline works for arbitrarily long lines, and both Brightness and Simlines
work as per the spec.

The Simlines program is split into three parts: simlines.c, readaline.c, and
normalize.c. Normalize has functionality for normalizing and cleaning 
input strings.

### Hours
We spent approcimately 20 hours completing this assignment, not including time
spent researching on our own or going to lectures/recitations.
